1. Type this into a python file and run it
# I'm going to store something in a variable
a = "Hello, world!"
# yay, I made my first variable, now I can print it out
print(a)

2. Let's store an integer in a variable. Add this to your python file and run it
my_integer = 123
print(my_integer)

3. Try assigning to the same variable more than once. What do you think will happen? Try it
my_variable = "Cats have nice paws"
print(my_variable)
my_variable = 2.71828
print(my_variable)

4. We can do maths with numbers stored inside variables. Try this:
a = 4
b = 7.2
print(a * b)
c = b - a
print(c)

5. We can use one variable to create another variable. Try This:
a = 4
b = a + 2
print(a)
print(b)
a = 20
print(b)
