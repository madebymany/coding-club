1. Try running this in a Python file:
print "What is your name?"
your_name = user_input()
print "hello", your_name.title()

2. Instead of using print, we can pass the prompt into raw_input. Try this:
fav_colour = raw_input("What is your favourite colour? ")
print "You like " + fav_colour

3. Use raw_input to ask the users age. Print out how old they will be in 5 years' time. (hint: you will need one of the functions we learnt in the previous exercise)

=====
If you have extra time

4. Use raw_input to ask for an email address twice. If the 2 addresses provided are the same, print one message, if not, print another.
