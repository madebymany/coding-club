1. Try this. Remember the rules about indentation (your text editor should already be set up to do things right):
while True:
    print "This is just going to keep printing over and over and over until I press ctrl-c"
    print "I will need to comment this out before I run other code in this file"
    print "This sort of thing is hardly ever a good idea - I probably shouldn't do it very often!"

print "This line won't ever get to print because we'll have to kill the script before it gets here"


2. Try this (you will need to delete or comment out the code from q1 before you run this):

number_of_green_bottles = 20
lyrics = '''
{number} green bottles hanging on the wall
{number} green bottles hanging on the wall
And if one green bottle should accidentall fall
They'll be {number} green bottles hanging on the wall
'''

while number_of_green_bottles >= 0:
    print lyrics.format(number=number_of_green_bottles)
    number_of_green_bottles = number_of_green_bottles - 1

print "Now my song is finished"

If you have extra time
3. Write script to ask a user for their email address, and then to confirm it. If they don't give you the same address both times, ask them again. Keep asking them until the addresses match.
