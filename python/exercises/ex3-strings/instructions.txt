In a new python file (make sure you use the right extension), type out these lines one by one, and run your file after each line:

print "here is a string with nothing very much exciting going on"

print 'I can use single quotes instead if I feel like it'

print "\tThis string will be indented"

print "This string will have one line\nand another line\nand yet another line\nand a 4th one"

print """
That last string was a bit hard to read
If I want to do multi line strings that are a bit easier
to understand I can use three quotes like this
"""

print "What if I want to put some \"quotes\" inside my string? I can use backslashes (\\) to do that"

print 'That was a bit convoluted. If I want "s in my string, I can use single quotes around it instead of "s'

"Here is a string that I'm making, but I won't see it on the terminal because I haven't passed it into a print statement"
