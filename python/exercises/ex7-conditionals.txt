1. Type this into a python file and run it
if True:
    print("This is something that is going to print") # this line needs to have 4 spaces at the beginning

if False:
    print("This is something that is not going to print") # this line need to have 4 spaces at the beginning
    print("This is something else that is not going to print") # this line need to have 4 spaces at the beginning
print("This is something else that is going to print") # this line needs to have no spaces at the beginning


2. Let's use the comparison operators we learnt about earlier to do something a bit more interesting
if 1.2 < 3:
    print("This will print because the statement above evaluates to True")

if "cat" == "dog":
    print("This won't print because cats are not dogs, and neither are dogs cats")

3. Let's use an else block to print out something when the if block doesn't print
my_cat = "Ronnie-cat"

if my_cat == "Ronnie-cat":
    print("Hello Ronnie-cat, lovely to see you today!")
else:
    print("Hello, you are not the cat I was expecting, but it's lovely to see you anyway!")

print("Now I have greeted the cat who came to see me")

4. Change the name of the cat in your my_cat variable to see your else block work.

5. We can use elif blocks to deal with multiple different conditions
my_cat = "Ronnie-cat"

if my_cat == "Ronnie-cat":
    print("Hello Ronnie-cat, lovely to see you today!")
elif my_cat == "Tootsie":
    print("Hello Tootsie, I am glad you came to visit! Here, have some fish!")
elif my_cat == "Tom":
    print("Hello Tom, it's very nice of you to visit me all the way from outer space! Where are you going next on your adventures?")
else:
    print("Hello, you are not one of the cats I was expecting, but it's lovely to see you anyway!")

print("Now I have greeted the cat who came to see me")

6. Change the name of your my_cat variable and re-run your file to see all the different options.

7. Make a variable called number_of_treats and assign an integer to it. Write  if, elif and else statements to express Tilly's reaction to different numbers of treats. e.g. when number_of_treats is 5, your response might be "Tilly thinks this is a reasonable number of treats, but she would like some more please"
