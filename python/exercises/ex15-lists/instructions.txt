1. Try this:
animals = ["parrot", "antelope", "hamster"]
first_animal = animals[0]
print "The first animal in my list is {}".format(first_name)
print "The third animal in my list is {}".format(animals[2])
number_of_animals = len(animals)
print "There are {} animals in my list".format(number_of_animals)

animals.append("Jellyfish")
animals.append("ferret")
print "I have added some more animals to my list. There are now {} animals in my list".format(len(animals))
print "The last animal in my list is {}".format(animals[-1])
print "The second last animal in my list is {}".format(animals[-2])

last_animal = animals.pop()
print "I have popped an animal off my list and into a variable. The animal is {}".format(last_animal)
print "There are now {} animals left in my list and the one at the end is {}".format(len(animals), animals[-1])

2. Try this:
my_numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
my_numbers_total = sum(my_numbers)
print "The sum of all the numbers in my list {} is {}".format(my_numbers, my_numbers_total)

print "The third number in my list is {}".format(my_numbers[2])
print "16 is at index {} in my_numbers"".format(my_numbers.index(16))

my_numbers.append("not a number")
print "Now my numbers list looks like this {}. What will happen if I try to sum it?".format(my_numbers)

sum(my_numbers)

3. Try this:
my_list = [1, "frog", "penguin", False]
print "There are {} items in my list".format(len(my_list))

print 1 in my_list

if "frog" in my_list:
    print "there is a frog in my list"

print "dinosaur" not in my_list

print False in my_list

4. Create a list containing some animal names. Use raw_input to ask the user to guess one of the animal names. Use a loop to keep asking them to guess until they get one of them. Swap with someone else to play each others' guessing games.
