Yay, you found Ronnie Cat. Well done!
Ronnie Cat is very happy to see you. Purr purr purr.
He is eating some ham, which is his favourite.

Ronnie Cat tells you a very funny programming joke:
`A guy walks into a bar and asks for 1.014 root beers.
The bartender says, “I’ll have to charge you extra, that’s a root beer float”.
So the guy says, “In that case, better make it a double.`
