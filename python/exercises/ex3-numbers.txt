1. In a new python file (make sure you use the right extension!). Type the following:

print("If I have five kittens and they make friends with seven tortoises, the number of happy animals will be:")

print(5 + 7)

print("If two of the tortoises go off to explore the world, the number of tortoises left will be:", 7 - 2)

print("If each kitten finds a matching bunny, in total there will be", 5 * 2, "kitten and bunnies")

print("if half of the kittens are selected for a kitten reality TV program, there will be", 5/2, "kittens left")

2. Save and run the file. Have a look at the outputs - are they what you expected?
