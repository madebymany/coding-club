Yay, you found Tom the space cat! Not many people make it out to see Tom because he uses lots of annoying spaces in his files names.

As well as adventuring, Tom's favourite passtime is annoying people with spaces, because he is a very contrary cat.

Tom tells you a very funny programming joke:
Knock knock.
Race condition.
Who's there?
