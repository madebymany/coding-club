Yay, you found Tootsie. Well done!
Tootsie is pleased to see you, but she's bit worried you're going to steal her salmon. Meow Meow.
Tootsie tells you her secret wish is to have a whole salmon farm of her very own, perhaps you could buy one for her?

Tootsie tells you a very funny programming joke:
Why did the programmer quit her job?
Because she didnâ€™t get arrays.
