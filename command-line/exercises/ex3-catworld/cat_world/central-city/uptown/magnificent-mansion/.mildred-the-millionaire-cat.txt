Mildred is not sure how you found her in her fancy mansion, but she enjoys showing it off to you. Purr, purr
She also shows you her shiny Catillac car

Mildred tells you a very funny programmer joke:
An engineer, a manager, and a programmer are riding in a car. They come to a hill and their brakes fail. After careening down the hill and finally coming to a stop they get out to decide what to do. The manager says “We need to have a meeting to form a committee to see what we should do next!” The engineer says, “Screw that! Give me a pocket knife and some duck tape and I’ll have us going in no time!” The programmer looks at them both and says, “Lets push it back to the top and see if it does it again.”
